Potter is a **P**r**O**ject **T**ime **T**rack**ER** for Microsoft Windows® that automatically detects when you are AFK.
It displays a dialog every n minutes in which you can enter (or keep) the current work description.
In addition the current work description can be changed via a tray icon.
The time segments are sent to a freely configurable tool (by default, they are attached to a text file).
